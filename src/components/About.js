            <p>Hi! This is a student project I built using React.
            I've built calculators before, but I'm most proud of this one.</p>
            <p>I learned React almost entirely 
            from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8">this</a> tutorial, 
            so shout out to Bob Ziroll.
            If you've never check out freecodecamp I highly highly recommend them.</p>
            <p>Anyway, if you want any of my links the important ones are in the Footer.</p>
            <p>Cheers!</p>
